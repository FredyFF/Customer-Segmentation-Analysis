Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) about Customer Segmentation Analysis and clustering with KMeans Clustering Algorithm

I have explored the Mall Customer Segmentation Data dataset to find the answers for the following questions:
1. What is the average customer visit the mall?
2. What is the average customer income?
3. What is the Spending Score of each customer?
4. How is the data distribution so that it can provide insight?
5. In what age range are customers who shop at the mall?
6. How many customer clusters are there at the mall?
